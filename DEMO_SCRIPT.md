## üìù **Sample Answers for Demo**

### **Easy Question**: "Explain what React is and why companies choose it"
**Answer**: "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. Companies choose React because of its virtual DOM for better performance, component-based architecture for reusability, strong ecosystem, and excellent developer experience with tools like React DevTools."

### **Medium Question**: "How would you handle state management in a large React application?"
**Answer**: "For large applications, I'd use Redux Toolkit for global state management, React Context for component-specific state, and local useState for simple component state. Redux provides predictable state updates, time-travel debugging, and excellent DevTools support."

### **Hard Question**: "Design a scalable system for handling real-time notifications"
**Answer**: "I'd use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for real-time communication, implement a message queue system like Redis for handling high throughput, use database indexing for efficient queries, and implement caching strategies with CDN for global distribution."
